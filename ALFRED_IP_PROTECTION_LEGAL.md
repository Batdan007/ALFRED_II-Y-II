## Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Code Integrity Verification
- **HMAC-SHA256 signatures** on all critical files
- **Cryptographic hashing** to detect modifications
- **Tamper detection** with automatic alerts
- **Immutable audit trail** of all changes

### 2. Database Protection
- **AES-256 encryption** of brain database backups
- **Hash verification** prevents unauthorized clones
- **Access logging** tracks who accesses brain data
- **Copy detection** identifies stolen databases

### 3. Algorithm Protection
- **Fingerprinting** of proprietary algorithms
- **Signature matching** detects reimplemented versions
- **Similarity detection** identifies suspicious implementations
- **Behavioral analysis** catches subtle copies

### 4. Access Control
- **Device fingerprinting** verifies authorized systems
- **Authorization checking** before any brain access
- **Audit logging** of all operations
- **Real-time alerts** for suspicious activity

### 5. Notification System
- **Immediate alerts** to BATDAN on any threat
- **Detailed logging** of all incidents
- **Evidence preservation** for legal action
- **Emergency notifications** for critical threats

## What Happens If Someone Tries to Copy ALFRED

### Automatic Detection

When someone attempts to:

**Copy the source code:**
```
DETECTION: File hash matches known ALFRED code
ACTION: 
  1. Log attempt with full details
  2. Alert BATDAN immediately
  3. Record IP/location/timestamp
  4. Preserve evidence
```

**Steal the brain database:**
```
DETECTION: Database file copied to unauthorized location
ACTION:
  1. Detect file size/hash match
  2. Alert BATDAN with critical priority
  3. Log perpetrator information
  4. Create incident report
```

**Reverse engineer algorithms:**
```
DETECTION: Code contains ALFRED algorithm signatures
ACTION:
  1. Identify specific algorithm theft
  2. Alert BATDAN of IP theft
  3. Log suspicious file location
  4. Document evidence
```

### Notification to BATDAN

Alert includes:
- **Type** of threat detected
- **Severity** level (CRITICAL)
- **Location** of unauthorized file/access
- **Timestamp** of detection
- **Evidence** (hashes, signatures, etc.)
- **Recommended actions**
- **Contact information** for immediate response
