# ALFRED - AI That Actually Remembers You
## The Simple Version

---

## What Is It?

ALFRED is an AI assistant like Siri or ChatGPT - but with one big difference:

**It remembers everything.**

ChatGPT forgets you exist after every conversation. ALFRED doesn't.

## Why Does That Matter?

Because companies are paying HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS for this exact thing:

| Company | What They Raised | What Happened |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| **Rewind AI** | $33 million | **Sold to Meta (Facebook)** at $350M valuation |
| **Rabbit R1** | $30 million | Makes a $199 gadget |
| **Humane AI Pin** | $230 million | Makes a $699 gadget |
| **Mem AI** | $23.5 million | Note-taking app valued at $110M |

**ALFRED does what these do - without expensive hardware.**

## Is This Real?

**Yes.**

- **Working Code:** Over 10,000 lines, running right now

This isn't a PowerPoint. It's a working product.
