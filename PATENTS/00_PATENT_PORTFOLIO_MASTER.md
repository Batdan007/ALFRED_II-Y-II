## FAMILY 1: ALFRED Brain (FILED)

**Provisional Filed:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** ACTIVE - Priority Date Established

**Core Innovation:** 11-table SQLite architecture with dual-scoring memory weighting (Importance x Confidence) enabling sub-millisecond recall.

**Implementation:** `core/brain.py`

---

## FAMILY 2: ALFREDGuardian

**Status:** DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Core Innovation:** IP protection through embedded behavioral fingerprints that survive code transformation.

**Implementation:** `core/guardian.py`

---

## FAMILY 3: CORTEX - The Forgetting Brain

**Status:** DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Core Innovation:** 5-layer memory architecture with active forgetting:
- Flash (seconds) -> Working (minutes) -> Short-Term (hours) -> Long-Term (days) -> Archive (compressed)
- Bounded storage growth through controlled decay
- Quality improves as noise is forgotten

**Implementation:** `core/cortex.py`

---

## FAMILY 4: ULTRATHUNK

**Status:** DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Core Innovation:** Atomic compressed intelligence units achieving 640:1+ compression through generative patterns.

**Example:** 47 weather conversations (100KB) -> 1 Ultrathunk (156 bytes) -> Infinite personalized outputs

**Implementation:** `core/ultrathunk.py`

---

## FAMILY 5: NEXUS Protocol

**Status:** DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Core Innovation:** Universal AI-to-AI communication standard enabling autonomous interaction without human intermediaries.

**Implementation:** `core/nexus.py`
